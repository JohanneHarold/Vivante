# AutoClicker Record-Play-Random Clicks

## AutoClicker Record-Play-Random Clicks for Windows PC Desktop (formerly AutoClicker Record-Play Script Of Clicks)

This is professional and open source fork of AutoClicker - the most popular mouse auto clicker application for Windows PC Desktop. It has already fixed many bugs of the predecessor and will add many intriguing features in the future, keeping clean and accurate test-driven developing process to be always free of bugs (as you might remember, AutoClicker itself was quite full of bugs).

AutoClicker Record-Play-Random Clicks is a TRIPLE-MODE AUTO CLICKER: 1) following mouse cursor 2) clicking at user-defined position or whole clicking sequence that can be recored, saved to a file, loaded from it and played back 3) random clicking in a maximum bounding rectangle determined automatically on a previously saved clicking sequence.

Mouse trigger keys (hotkeys) work when the application is minimized (in the background) for convenience. You can select Left, Middle, Right mouse button to click as well as click type - Single, Double, Triple. All the settings are saved automatically between program's starts.

AutoClicker Record-Play-Random Clicks installs Microsoft .Net 4.5.x automatically if your computer has no this component. Windows 10 typically has it.

Features:
* Supports auto-clicking at current mouse position or at user-picked position. NOT ONLY SINGLE CLICKS BUT THE WHOLE CLICKING SEQUENCES ARE SUPPORTED to be recored, saved to a file, read from it and played back.
* Supports arbitrary finite times of clicking as well as infinite clicking.
* Supports Left, Middle, Right mouse button to click.
* Supports Single, Double and Triple clicking.
* Supports trigger key change (picked by user).
* Supports clicking while the application is minimized (in the background).
* All the settings are saved automatically between application run-times.
* Elegant and intuitively-understood graphical user interface.
* Free and open source without Ads and Viruses forever.
* NEW. Press-only mode for mouse clicks (without release the mouse button). It is a feature so it holds the click button instead of clicking multiple times.
* NEW. Trigger key defaults to DELETE that clears the clicking sequence is now changeable as other trigger keys. You may select another key if DELETE trigger affects other applications.
* NEW. Random clicking feature in a desktop area given has been implemented. Just record a sequence of clicks as usual and save it to a text file. Then add keyword 'random_square_clicking' as the first line of the file and load it back from the disk to the application. AutoClicker will determine the maximum bounding rectangle by the points given in the file and generates 1000 random clicking events in that rectangle. The clicks generated can be fired to Windows in an infinite cycle or by number of clicks given in the GUI as well as can be saved into another text file and loaded from it as usual.
* NEW. Menu item "Save for random clicking" has been added for your convenience. Now you need no external text editor to add a keyword described above. Just record arbitrary amount of points to form a bounding rectangle by pressing "F3" in "Fixed Pos." mode than do "File"->"Save for random clicking", select desired file name, remember it and load the file back via "File"->"Load".
