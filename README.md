## AutoClicker Professional for Windows PC Desktop

This is professional and open source fork of AutoClicker - the most popular mouse auto clicker application for Windows PC Desktop. It has already fixed many bugs of the predecessor and will add many intriguing features in the future, keeping clean and accurate test-driven developing process to be always free of bugs (as you might remember, AutoClicker itself was quite full of bugs).

AutoClicker Professional is a mature and advanced full-featured mouse auto clicker with two modes of clicking - following the mouse cursor and fixed position clicking. This is the only open source clicking program that supports record/save/load/play the whole sequence of user-defined mouse clicks at fixed desktop positions.
